## Google Patents Classification 
_Economics RA for Professor Ethan G. Lewis_

I'm working on matching patent and industry electricity-use datasets.  

## Maze Algorithm in C
_Class project for CS 50 ("Software Design and Implementation")._

{{< figure src="/pics/maze_alg.gif" title="Our algorithm solving an 8-player maze game" >}}

Along with Boxian Wang, Michael Canche, and Daniel Diaz, I wrote a program in C that communicates with a game server and implemenents our own maze game solving algorithm based on the Floyd-Warshall algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm.

The program attempts to minimize the total number of moves it takes 2-10 randomly positioned players to meet given no knowledge of where walls are in a randomly generated perfect maze of between 25 and 10,000 locations ([project description](https://perma.cc/HNS7-L6MB "2020 Winter CS 50 Final Project Description"), [project description](https://perma.cc/Q7XV-WQJ7 "2020 Winter CS 50 Final Project Requirements")).

## Medicare Public Use File Analysis
_Class project for QSS 30.01 ("Applied Machine Learning to the Social Sciences")._

{{< figure src="/pics/tree-cst.png" title="Pruned decision tree predicting Medicare claim cost" >}}

I created, analyzed ([pdf](/work/QSS_30.01_Medicare_PUF_Paper.pdf) [rmd](/work/QSS_30.01_Medicare_PUF_Code.rmd)) and presented ([pdf](/work/QSS_30.01_Medicare_PUF_Presentation.pdf) [rmd](/work/QSS_30.01_Medicare_PUF_Presentation_Code.rmd)) basic statistical learning models trained in R on data from the 2010 basic stand alone [Medicare claims public use files dataset](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/BSAPUFS/Carrier_Line_Items.html) to investigate relationships between a variety of factors in the Medicare claims dataset and the costs of those claims.
