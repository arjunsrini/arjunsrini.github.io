  <h1>Projects @ Dartmouth</h1>

  <h2>Economics RA</h2>
  <p>
    I'm working on matching patent and industry electricity-use datasets for Professor Ethan G. Lewis.  
  </p>
  <p></p>

  <h2>Maze Algorithm in C</h2>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Along with Boxian Wang, Michael Canche, and Daniel Diaz, I wrote a program in C that communicates with a game server and implemenents our own maze game solving algorithm based on the Floyd-Warshall algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm.
  </p>
  <p>
    The program attempts to minimize the total number of moves it takes 2-10 randomly positioned players to meet given no knowledge of where walls are in a randomly generated perfect maze of between 25 and 10,000 locations (<a href="https://perma.cc/HNS7-L6MB">project description</a>, <a href="https://perma.cc/Q7XV-WQJ7">project requirements</a>).

 <h2>Machine Learning on Medicare Claims Data</h2> 
 <p>
  <i>Class project for QSS 30.01 ("Applied Machine Learning to the Social Sciences")</i>
 </p>
  <p>
    <figure src="/images/tree-cst.png" title="Pruned decision tree predicting Medicare claim cost" >Pruned decision tree predicting Medicare claim cost</figure>
  </p>  
  <p>
    I created, analyzed (pdf, rmd), and presented (pdf, rmd) basic statistical learning models trained in R on data from the 2010 basic stand alone Medicare claims public use files dataset to show what factors best predict high claims costs.
